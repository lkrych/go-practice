//think of this exercise like a variation of mancala. 
//Starting at the zeroth index, can you navigate to the last index using the number of hops given to you at each index?
//You may use less than the number of hops given to you at each index
//return true if you can, return false if it is impossible
//ex [3,3,1,0,2,0,1] is true
// hop once from 3 to 3, hop three times to two and hop twice to 1!
//ex [3,2,0,0,2,0,1] is false
// the farthest you can hop is to index 4
