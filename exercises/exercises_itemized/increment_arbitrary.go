//take in an array of digits encoding a decimal, d and update the array to rep d + 1
//ex: 1.29 => 1.30 ~ [1,2,9] => [1,3,0]
//ex 1.48372 => 1.48373 
//TAKE AWAY:  This algorithm should work in a language that has finite-precision arithmetic
//Arrays can be used to break up numbers of arbitrary size, this allows us to handle very big numbers!
