## Exercise Generator 

Run `go run exercise_generator.go` to get started.

This script will create a `./go_exercises` folder with the file `exercises.go` and `exercises_test.go`.

To test your code, navigate into the `./go_exercises` folder and run `go test`.

Fill in the exercises in `./go_exercises/exercises.go` until all your tests pass.
